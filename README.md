# UI Based AEM Component Generator

 *  This is a project to help others developers like me who spends time to generate components and dialogs and creating Sling model or React components.
 *  This project also helps requirement analyst who does not have knowledge about AEM component development but still can create AEM Dialog by Drag and Drop for developers to start implementating on actual logic
 *  This project also helps Frontend developers who does not have knowledge about AEM backend component, now they can create Dialog and start implemting Frontend logic whithout waiting for Backend developers dependency.

## Work in progress

* Java Code generation
* React Code generation
* Design dialog creation

Please follow settings file on how to configure.



## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

## Testing

There are three levels of testing contained in the project:

* unit test in core: this show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To test, execute:

    mvn clean test

* server-side integration tests: this allows to run unit-like tests in the AEM-environment, ie on the AEM server. To test, execute:

    mvn clean verify -PintegrationTests

* client-side Hobbes.js tests: JavaScript-based browser-side tests that verify browser-side behavior. To test:

    in the browser, open the page in 'Developer mode', open the left panel and switch to the 'Tests' tab and find the generated 'MyName Tests' and run them.

## ClientLibs

The frontend module is made available using an [AEM ClientLib](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/clientlibs.html). When executing the NPM build script, the app is built and the [`aem-clientlib-generator`](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) package takes the resulting build output and transforms it into such a ClientLib.

A ClientLib will consist of the following files and directories:

- `css/`: CSS files which can be requested in the HTML
- `css.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `css/` so they can be merged)
- `js/`: JavaScript files which can be requested in the HTML
- `js.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `js/` so they can be merged
- `resources/`: Source maps, non-entrypoint code chunks (resulting from code splitting), static assets (e.g. icons), etc.

## Maven settings

The project comes with the auto-public repository configured. To setup the repository in your Maven settings, refer to:
